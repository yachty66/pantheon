üíµ Raise money

## Fund your company on your own

Invest in your own company by contributing personal funds to the business. Be careful though - you may not get back what you put in. Decide how much you‚Äôre willing to invest, and transfer that amount from your personal bank account into your business bank account.

Depending how long you‚Äôve been in business for, your company may be eligible for debt financing. Reach out to local banks, or consider government small business loans. You may also be eligible for financing from providers like Capchase (https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/capchase) or Stripe Capital (https://stripe.com/capital).

## Consider crowdfunding

You don‚Äôt have to have a physical product to crowdfund. Crowdfunding sites for startups like Republic (https://republic.com/raise) and Wefunder (https://wefunder.com) can be a good way to build interest in your product or service, and discover new investors.

## Apply for grants or accelerators

Many local, state, and federal governments offer limited non-dilutive grant funding for new businesses. You may also consider applying for a startup accelerator, which supports early-stage startups with mentorship, education, and financing.

## Raise venture capital

C-Corporations often issue equity in exchange for cash financing from angel investors or venture capitalists.
