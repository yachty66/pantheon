There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders \\u2013 the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur drug will target mitochondria \\u2013 the powerhouse of the cell \\u2013 to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does.

Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom our early days of automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, to pioneering a brand-new market as the leading Trust Management Platform, our vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security remains unchanged. Now more than ever, making security continuous\\u2014not just a point-in-time check\\u2014 is essential. Vanta is the leading Trust Management Platform that helps simplify and centralize security for organizations of all sizes. Over 4,000 companies including Autodesk, Chili Piper, Flo Health and Quora, rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust\\u2014all in a way that's real-time and transparent.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently named the #1 Leader in G2's Winter 2023 Grid\\u00ae Reports for Security Compliance, Vanta debuted a number of new product innovations over the last year, including Access Reviews which automates the once-manual, time-consuming access reviews process and an enhanced Risk Management solution allowing companies to holistically understand, prioritize, and reduce risks within their company to build a stronger security approach and demonstrate compliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nVanta was built on the idea that software can be used to do amazing things for the world\\u2014if we trust it to do so.

This technology could change the way the oil and gas industry, water municipalities, and anyone dealing with high volume fluid, operates. Fleets of our proprietary lightweight hardware send raw ultrasonic data directly to our server via cellular/satellite; we then use a mix of physics equations, signal processing, and anomaly detection to determine the behavior of fluid (volume and speed) in pipes.\",\n",

Hunger is not a scarcity problem; it's a logistics problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time ever, we can effectively donate prepared and highly perishable food to those who need it when we need it most. Copia is a for-profit company that has built technology allowing businesses (e.g., food management companies like Compass Group, corporate cafeterias, universities, hospitals, grocers, caterers, etc.) to easily request pickups of their surplus food, have it matched, and safely delivered to non-profits in need. With Copia, partnering businesses can seamlessly access significant tax savings, dramatically reduce food waste through data and analytics on surplus, and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all while feeding their community.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have diverted over 7M pounds of edible food from landfills and provided businesses and nonprofits with over $23M in savings. We will feed over 7M people with incredible food that would have otherwise been wasted!\",\n",

Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\\r\\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\\r\\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn\\u2019t otherwise remember.\",\n",

Our platform takes a 12% cut, making this a $400mm opportunity that is more than doubling every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nPressing plants are backed up years out, bots buy limited releases in seconds, and record prices are skyrocketing in both retail and aftermarket sales. Despite this growth, the only dedicated marketplace is difficult to use, doesn\\u2019t process transactions, yet facilitates over $600mm in vinyl exchanges per year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why I finally decided to quit my job at Google and recruit my best friends from college to fix it. We\\u2019re all software engineers and have been passionate about music and vinyl since we were kids, and have $50k in records ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started building a marketplace in July and launched our website 4 weeks ago.

Cardmembers gain access to high interest checking, financial education, and a community of ambitious women. Plus, each Sequin Card is customized with a money mantra!\\r\\n\\r\\nVrinda Gupta, the founder and CEO, launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve at Visa, where she was rejected from the credit card she built! She learned that 70% of women today were making avoidable financial mistakes like she was, and embarked on a mission to close gender-based financial gaps. She teamed up with ex-PayPal engineering leader, Mark Thomas, co-founder and CTO, to build a membership-based banking designed to empower women financially.\\r\\n\\r\\nSequin is backed by high-profile investors such as the Schwab Family, Y Combinator, and IDEO Ventures and is an official Visa partner. The team plans to expand its offerings into a $65B largely untapped market for women's financial products from first bank account to retirement products.\",\n",

This eliminates Lizards and Sales Agents, saving the other 25%.\\r\\nWe do not use the standard industry models, instead using a multiperil model to more granularly price risk.  This means that for a few of you we are more expensive... but everyone else pays much less than they would otherwise pay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including:\\r\\n    - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor\\r\\n    - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old)\\r\\n    - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly)\\r\\n    - added coverage for mold removal\\r\\n\\r\\nOur MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, \\\"renting\\\" capacity as we need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors.\",\n",

Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren\\u2019t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we\\u2019ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, we\\u2019re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.\",\n",

But we did have an idea: what if we could build financial software that powers our democracy? \\r\\n\\r\\nRunning for office is hard work \\u2013 the outdated software that runs campaigns makes it even harder. We believe it doesn\\u2019t have to be that way. That\\u2019s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $24 billion in contributions to political campaigns.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur core product is a CRM software suite that includes a native mobile app, payment processor, referral tracker, and event management system to keep donations, pledges, and donors organized in a single place. We also just launched Electables \\u2013 a grassroots fundraising platform enabling campaigns to reward their donors with unique digital collectibles. Every product we build saves our clients hours of work every week either via automation, smarter data processing, or even simply better UX. We also always build an embedded fintech component (e.g. we process payments on behalf of our clients) so that we earn revenue with every dollar our clients raise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staff, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince our founding, we've served over 1,000 clients at every level from city council to US Senate (who have collectively managed $2B+ of contributions on our platform). And there\\u2019s much more room for us to grow. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government.\",\n",

The founders Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD have over 30 years of combined experience in business and product development, bioprocessing and biopharma. After only 4 months of development time, Orbillion has four different flavorful meats growing in the lab: wagyu beef, elk, sheep and American bison. Using their proprietary platform technology, Orbillion is rapidly decreasing the cost of cultivated meat.

This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \\\"fake news\\\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program. Its customers include Google, Lyft, Kickstarter, AirBnb, Coursera, Bonobos, Spotify, Vimeo, Bustle, and many others.\",\n",

The primary reason these workers cannot get their match is because they do not have enough to both cover living expenses and invest. \\r\\n\\r\\nLendtable helps workers get thousands in additional income by giving them a cash advance to cover their living expenses so they can finally begin earning their employer match. Once their money has vested we take some of the match money earned in order to cover our expenses. \\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers now have thousands of dollars more without putting any money down, and we make money helping them do so -- we win if they win.\",\n",

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO\\u00ae, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOsmind is a San Francisco\\u2013based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.\",\n",

Engineers need to design all structural elements such as walls, columns, and beams to ensure the structure will not collapse and complies with regulations.  The structural engineer needs four to six weeks to generate the initial solution. The engineer will submit his proposal to the architect and then engage in an extensive back and forth discussion until they agree on a satisfying solution. TANGObuilder generates the building structural design in real-time, cutting six weeks of the overall process, and reducing material usage by 30%.\",\n",

Earn some extra cash.\\nLet backpack help you save that high shipping cost or earn a little extra.\\n\\nBackpack is a peer-to-peer platform that connects travelers and shoppers to give people access to products across markets in all continents. \\nEach backpacker, regardless of their role as a carrier or a shopper, follows a simple four-step process to either earn or save money from their backpacking experience.\\nTravelers share their travel information and specify what kind of items they want to carry. Then they wait to get a \\\"backpack request\\\" and ask their price. Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they \\\"request backpack\\\" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money.  \\n\\nbackpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.\\nWhether the product is state-of-the-art consumer electronics, exotic pashmina from the south-east, or even medication that are rare in some parts of the world and not so rare in others - we promise ourselves to get those products to your doorsteps. We would like to reject the counterfeits, we would like to reject the almost-originals, most importantly, we would like to not pay the heavy expense incurred, most of which we deem to be superfluous. Help us make a better, more original globalized world.\",\n",

We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\\r\\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\\r\\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.\",\n",

It's fragmented across PEOs, gig marketplaces, and consumer remittance platforms. With their local currency weakening against the US Dollar, they need control on how and when to repatriate funds.

Instead of you wading through pages of clickbait Google results or adding \\\"reddit\\u201d to your search, we serve you the products you would otherwise spend hours researching for. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the internet and search have evolved, it has become increasingly obvious that searching the whole internet is now a bug, not a feature. In today\\u2019s era of constant information overload, finding the best products to meet your needs amid a sea of SEO-spam and sneaky advertising has never been harder. Imagine trying to find an effective skincare routine, currently you have to comb through countless YouTube videos and Reddit threads to understand the steps of what an ideal routine looks like for you before even deciding which products you want. Lumona simplifies those steps into one search, showing the best products for you, as recommended by the content creators you watch and the communities you visit every day, in one place. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been working together since meeting during our sophomore year at MIT, recently winning first place at the HackMIT hackathon this past September. As part of MIT\\u2019s student-run Web Lab class, we taught over 300 students modern web development. Growing up in the age of social media, we\\u2019ve always been influenced by content creators in the products we buy, and have spent endless hours learning how to research and shop for the products we need amid an internet drowning in noise. We are committed to fixing product search\\u2014so that you never have to add \\u201creddit\\u201d to the end of your searches ever again.\",\n",

Plug in your LLM, a voice agent is born!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom AI-powered call agents to voice-enabled coaching apps and lifelike companions, we are your trusted ally in turning these visions into reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Voice AI has been around for some time, it hasn't yet become effective enough for mainstream use, primarily because of poor user experience. Conversational flows often feel awkward with unnatural pauses and interruptions, requests are frequently misunderstood, and voices sound robotic or overly dramatic. On top of that, setting up such a Voice AI system can require upwards of 100 hours of frustrating development.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy offering a truly conversational, fast, and empathetic Voice AI that can be easily configured for any industry and integrated into any product, we aim to push the boundary of user-friendliness to a new level, reaching the threshold for mainstream adoption of Voice AI.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are at a pivotal moment in history where Voice AI will become the primary interface for accessing products and services, revolutionizing our interactions with machines for the better.\\r\\n\\r\\nRetell AI is at the forefront of creating this new reality.\",\n",

With Markprompt, companies can automate customer support, scale without increasing headcount, and deliver exceptional user experiences.\\r\\n \\r\\nScaling customer support with headcount is expensive, with human resources accounting for 90%+ of customer support expenses. On top of that, customer support agents often burn out leading to turnover and reduced quality. As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge, which is hard to access at scale and makes keeping employees up-to-date nearly impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI. Built from the ground up with an API-first approach, Markprompt provides SDKs (such as React hooks and components) and no-code tools to enable integrations at all touchpoints in the customer journey.\",\n",

We provide embedded data analytics more powerful than Tableau and Looker by pairing AI with code execution, which eliminates hallucinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nUser-facing analytics can be a pain to implement: regardless of what you build, users end up exporting data as CSV and analyzing it themselves. Instead, let the Lightski AI Data Scientist help your users explore their data, without ever leaving your app. After loading your user's data in, we generate and execute code to perform advanced analyses, such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Create custom graphs, charts, and dashboards\\r\\n- Perform arbitrary filters, group-bys, and aggregations\\r\\n- Transform or clean data for a custom CSV export\\r\\n\\r\\nBy writing and executing Python code to answer user questions, we provide grounded answers that avoid hallucinations. Since code is infinitely flexible, this approach enables arbitrary data questions to be quickly answered, without fiddling with UI, schemas, or technical knowledge. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnything that a data scientist can accomplish in code can now be accomplished with Lightski. Best of all, your users won\\u2019t even know we\\u2019re powering the experience\\u2014you can quickly re-theme our UI with your design system. Reach out at founders@lightski.com for a demo!\",\n",

As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\\r\\n\\r\\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \\r\\n\\r\\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.\",\n",

Our customers previously relied on LLMs for tagging text. They soon hit rate limits, high latency, and accuracy issues (LLMs are optimized for generative tasks, not structured classification). With Taylor, engineering teams get access to our proprietary models purpose-built for text classification. We have no rate limits, guaranteed latency, and straightforward pricing.\",\n",

There's quite a few payors in both medical and dental (e.g. Seledent) that have yet to offer a digital retrieval of benefits\\r\\n- We're reliable and consistent -- there is no person-to-person variation or skipping of steps when it comes to working with software\",\n",

Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Small businesses are the heart of the American economy and a lot of banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes and unlocks affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US as opposed to the high interest rates from online lenders.\",\n",

We were skeptical about that and decided to talk to users of platforms such as UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blueprism, all of them low-code.\\r\\n\\r\\nTalking to users, we discovered that unique automations incorporating exclusive company processes and intelligence that have the potential to transform the business must be implemented by tech teams. It's not about mimicking employees performing isolated tasks. It's about designing a new workflow, integrated with the company's technological stack and systems. There are just 100.000 RPA skilled users compared to 22M developers globally that can become RPA coders on Day 1 with BotCity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that all automation efforts in a single platform is more efficient. We started delivering the best RPA experience for tech teams, but we envision creating the perfect place to also manage crawlers, integrations, scrappers, data operations. Every company automation in a single place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs companies are becoming tech first and automation will be a basic KPI, we are building to be the all-in-one automation ops management.\",\n",

We're not just making collaboration faster\\u2014we're crafting it to be the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we\\u2019re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web\\u2014one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication\\u2014less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe're building a better web\\u2014a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together \\ud83d\\ude80\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Products:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\\r\\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\u2019re a team of ex-Googlers.
