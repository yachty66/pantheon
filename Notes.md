what are i am gonna build now? i can add a interface on the right side but i can also just leave it blank. its up to me what are i am going to do.

if i have this thing on the right side waht are i am going to add their? i can add the selector so that i can choose their what exactly i want to see. what will i be able to select on that right side - i am not sure yet tbh - i need to figure this out. what exactly are i am going to do now with the app - i am thinking - i am not sure. maybe i should just start of with building a basic map where i am able to render all the clubs from the ra. this would work too obviously i just need to check how exactly i am going to do it. 

i can build a banger website which is good and than people can open the map from there - this would be sick. i also can just have a mao where people can directly go to - this would be fun ofc.
