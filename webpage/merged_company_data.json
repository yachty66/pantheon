The pressure of low margins suffocates the truckers who actually do the work.\r\n\r\nOur software cuts out the inefficiencies, and we pass the savings through to our truckers. Instead of paper-pushers and endless phone calls, they get an end-to-end solution: customer management, load coordination, automated invoicing, and instant payments. A single place to manage their business.\r\n\r\nA blog post that goes deeper into why we started this company: https://medium.com/@jinstedge/truenorth-b42437f1dc03\r\n\r\nWe're a team of over 60, and proud to say the *majority* of us are female or non-binary.

Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment.  If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back.  \r\n\r\nI built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers.\r\n\r\nDex is a lightweight personal CRM that\u2019s easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you\u2019re in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can:\r\n\r\n- Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up.\r\n- Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off.\r\n- Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn\u2019t otherwise remember.",

Cardmembers gain access to high interest checking, financial education, and a community of ambitious women. Plus, each Sequin Card is customized with a money mantra!\r\n\r\nVrinda Gupta, the founder and CEO, launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve at Visa, where she was rejected from the credit card she built! She learned that 70% of women today were making avoidable financial mistakes like she was, and embarked on a mission to close gender-based financial gaps. She teamed up with ex-PayPal engineering leader, Mark Thomas, co-founder and CTO, to build a membership-based banking designed to empower women financially.\r\n\r\nSequin is backed by high-profile investors such as the Schwab Family, Y Combinator, and IDEO Ventures and is an official Visa partner. The team plans to expand its offerings into a $65B largely untapped market for women's financial products from first bank account to retirement products.",

We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren\u2019t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we\u2019ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we\u2019re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

This is where imgix has your back. imgix is a platform for managing, processing, rendering, optimizing, and delivering your existing visual assets so that you can meet the demands of your business and your team can stay focused on what they do best.\r\n\r\nThe business demands on web visual media can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program. Its customers include Google, Lyft, Kickstarter, AirBnb, Coursera, Bonobos, Spotify, Vimeo, Bustle, and many others.",

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO\u00ae, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco\u2013based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

        "description": "Blacksmith helps companies run their continuous integration (CI) up to twice as fast, at half the cost. We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs.\r\n\r\n- Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization.\r\n- On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers.\r\n- Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.",

Factories are forced to under-bid contracts to win business, but often, they later surprise the customer with quality problems and delays.\r\n\r\nThis process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.\r\n\r\nWe charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).\r\n\r\nIt encourages better behavior from factories and rewards those who perform with an audit trail of good performance that helps them win new foreign business.\r\n\r\nOn average, defect rate will fall 75% within 5 months of deploying Assembly at a factory.",

Most retail pricing teams settle for making decisions in spreadsheets, shooting in the dark, and working backward from a cost-plus margin target, leaving a LOT of money on the table.\r\n\r\nOur founders experienced these problems at scale when they built pricing tech at Uber that made Uber a billion dollars in profit a year. They realized that retail was lacking the same quality and sophistication of price tooling. So, they built Luca.\r\n\r\nLuca is an AI-powered co-pilot for retail operators, which constantly identifies revenue and profit headroom, makes recommendations for price adjustments and saves countless work hours along the way. \r\n\r\nLuca is backed by Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, and others.",

As a result, engineers take 8-12 months to become fully operational, enterprise code becomes slow and unmaintainable, and core knowledge is continually lost upon engineer turnover.\r\n\r\nSage is changing this reality. We take your code and automatically generate a symbol-level knowledge base that self-updates to remain forever fresh. We integrate with source control to pull your code and generate a symbolic graph representation of functions, classes, interfaces, types, etc., automatically determining the relevant context for each symbol, and using LLMs to annotate and propagate documentation via traversals of the symbol graph. \r\n\r\nSage revolutionizes the way teams and individuals interact with and understand their code, ensuring that knowledge is always accessible, up-to-date, and interactive.",

Engineers work in silos, unaware of how their decisions impact the broader system.\u00a0Changing the O-ring material might unexpectedly impact the seal integrity at low temperatures when building a space shuttle booster rocket (see NASA Space Shuttle Disaster).\r\n\r\nOur platform identifies design problems autonomously across engineering projects. It then suggests targeted solutions to the right engineers and delivers daily insights and reviews, preventing expensive problems early on (poor engineering cost Boeing $100B+).\u00a0 This saves each engineer 2 months of work every year and makes engineering safer.",

It's similar to Mint, Copilot, or Rocket Money, but our app issues you a checking account during onboarding so there's no syncing or flaky bank connections. We are structured to be the primary checking and savings account for our users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe (Josh and Katelyn) are married cofounders who previously worked on Apple Card and the Robinhood iOS app. We started Envelope because we were using clunky tools like the Chase app, spreadsheets, and Mint to run our family finances and realized we could do it better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, you could go set up a Chase account for checking, E-Trade for investing, SoFi for savings, Ally for money market, Greenlight for kid cards, PLUS the Mint/YNAB/Rocket Money to glue it all together + budgeting, or you could just use Envelope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Envelope Money is a financial technology company and is not a bank. Banking services provided by Pacific West Bank, Member FDIC. Your funds are FDIC insured up to $250,000 through Pacific West Bank, Member FDIC. The Envelope Money Visa\u00ae Debit Card is issued by Pacific West Bank, N.A. pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted._",
