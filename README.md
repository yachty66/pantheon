# Pantheon

The future of Maps

- [x] find minimalistic chatinterface for the left side
- [x] add a minimalistic field where a user can enter a text together with an button
- [ ] find a one examples from existing chatgpt plugin what can be worth to implement in combination with the map
    - [ ] user types in "go to X" and on the map it goes to X

should i do a custom implementation for now or should i use existing tepl

the thing holding me back using framework is that i later might want to use custom rendering in the app
how should i implement this part with the chatinterface. either i use vercel chatbot or i use 


if we build this from scratch than i dont even need supabase
