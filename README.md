## practical next steps

- [ ] make a kml file 
    - first create a basic kml file which contains one single marker with random image
    - if above works try to add a simple description to this 
- [ ] add all VC companies to the map
- [ ] make a selector button
- [ ] make button which when a user is clicking the button is than pasting the link to the user
- [ ] explain how a user can import the map in his google maps

how will i make this available to people - what i can do is to make a paid thing where people can select between maps and than there is a button which when clicked will contain the link. lets make a jupyter notebook which creates XML files based on my data.

## next steps

- [ ] Change the title and name of the repository to be more general, and add a selector to choose between different categories.
- [ ] Obtain a dataset with all universities in the US and integrate San Francisco universities into the map.
- [ ] Correct any inaccurate addresses of YC startups.

- [ ] Incorporate all VC companies from San Francisco into the map.
- [ ] Mark all electric car chargers on the map (consider discussing potential collaboration with my roommate on this).
- [ ] Gather all addresses of cooperative houses in San Francisco and add them.
- [ ] Add Airbnbs, Zillow listings, affordable restaurants, and running routes.
- [ ] Create an embedding of the YC data.
- [ ] Explore how users can utilize the map on their phones with Google Maps.
- [ ] Integrate a ChatGPT-like interface into the map to enable interaction with the data.
- [ ] Develop a website named "Pantheon," embedding Google Maps and offering pricing options.
- [ ] Include Wi-Fi-enabled cafes and clubs in San Francisco.
